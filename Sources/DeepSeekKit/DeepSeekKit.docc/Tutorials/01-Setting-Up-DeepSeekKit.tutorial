            DeepSeekKit can be added to your project using Swift Package Manager, the modern dependency management solution for Swift projects.

        @Steps {
            @Step {
                Open your project in Xcode and navigate to **File > Add Package Dependencies**.

            }
            
            @Step {
                Enter the DeepSeekKit repository URL in the search field.
                
                @Code(name: "Package URL", file: setup-01-url.txt)
            }
            
            @Step {
                Choose the version rule. For most projects, "Up to Next Major Version" is recommended.
                
                @Image(source: version-selection.png, alt: "Version selection in Xcode")
            }
            
            @Step {
                Add DeepSeekKit to your desired targets and click **Add Package**.
                
                @Image(source: target-selection.png, alt: "Target selection for DeepSeekKit")
            }
            
            @Step {
                Alternatively, if you're using Package.swift, add DeepSeekKit as a dependency.
                
                @Code(name: "Package.swift", file: setup-02-package.swift)
            }
        }
    }
    
    @Section(title: "Obtain Your API Key") {
        @ContentAndMedia {
            To use DeepSeek's AI models, you'll need an API key. Let's walk through obtaining and securely storing your credentials.
            
            @Image(source: api-key-setup.png, alt: "API key configuration")
        }
        
        @Steps {
            @Step {
                Visit the [DeepSeek Platform](https://platform.deepseek.com) and sign in to your account.
                
                @Image(source: deepseek-platform.png, alt: "DeepSeek platform homepage")
            }
            
            @Step {
                Navigate to the API Keys section in your account settings.
                
                @Image(source: api-keys-section.png, alt: "API Keys section in settings")
            }
            
            @Step {
                Create a new API key and copy it to your clipboard. Remember to keep this key secure!
                
                @Image(source: create-api-key.png, alt: "Creating a new API key")
            }
            
            @Step {
                For development, create an environment variable to store your API key securely. Never hardcode API keys in your source code.
                
                @Code(name: "Terminal", file: setup-03-env.sh)
            }
            
            @Step {
                For production iOS apps, use the Keychain to store sensitive data. Here's a simple helper.
                
                @Code(name: "KeychainHelper.swift", file: setup-04-keychain.swift) {
                    A basic Keychain wrapper to securely store your API key.
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    @Section(title: "Initialize DeepSeekKit") {
        @ContentAndMedia {
            With DeepSeekKit added to your project and your API key ready, let's create your first client instance.
            
            @Image(source: initialization.png, alt: "Initializing DeepSeekKit")
        }
        
        @Steps {
            @Step {
                Import DeepSeekKit in your Swift file.
                
                @Code(name: "ContentView.swift", file: setup-05-import.swift)
            }
            
            @Step {
                Create a DeepSeekClient instance with your API key.
                
                @Code(name: "ContentView.swift", file: setup-06-client.swift) {
                    The client is your gateway to all DeepSeek services.
                }
            }
            
            @Step {
                For SwiftUI apps, you might want to use @StateObject for your client.
                
                @Code(name: "ContentView.swift", file: setup-07-stateobject.swift) {
                    This ensures the client persists across view updates.
                }
            }
            
            @Step {
                Configure additional options if needed, such as custom base URL or timeout.
                
                @Code(name: "ContentView.swift", file: setup-08-configuration.swift) {
                    DeepSeekConfiguration provides full control over the client behavior.
                }
            }
        }
    }

            What is the recommended way to store your API key in a production iOS app?

                Hardcode it in your source code
                
                @Justification(reaction: "Never do this!") {
                    Hardcoding API keys in source code is a security risk. Anyone with access to your code can see and misuse your key.
                }

                Use the iOS Keychain
                
                @Justification(reaction: "Correct!") {
                    The Keychain provides encrypted storage for sensitive data and is the recommended approach for storing API keys and passwords.
                }
            }
            
            @Choice(isCorrect: false) {

                @Justification(reaction: "Also insecure") {
                    Plist files in your app bundle are readable by anyone who can access your app's files.
                }
            }

            Which dependency manager does DeepSeekKit support?
            
            @Choice(isCorrect: true) {
                Swift Package Manager
                
                @Justification(reaction: "That's right!") {
                    DeepSeekKit is distributed via Swift Package Manager, Apple's official dependency management solution.
                }
            }
            
            @Choice(isCorrect: false) {
                CocoaPods only
                
                @Justification(reaction: "Not quite") {
                    DeepSeekKit uses Swift Package Manager, not CocoaPods.

            @Choice(isCorrect: false) {
                Carthage only

                    DeepSeekKit is available through Swift Package Manager.

                @Justification(reaction: "There's a better way") {
                    While you could manually integrate it, Swift Package Manager makes it much easier.
